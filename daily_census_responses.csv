Pleasant location (see below).
- Conducted Rental Car audit against 3 small waves of incoming staffers to remote locations.
- Placed Rental Call Order with Logs to accomidate BCFS request to eliminate the use of personal vehciles in our remote locations and abide by their policy of 2 staffers max. per vehcile.
- Updated sign-in sheets to accomidate 7 incoming staffers.
- Coordinated with our amazing partners in Tyler, TX (shout out to Melanie and Skeeter!) to confirm transport of said nurses to our 4 locations.
- Tyler also confirmed that staff would arrive in (4) rental vehciles, allowing us to consolidate excess inventory a part of our aforementioned Rentl C ar Request this evening.
- Attended PM BCFS Briefing.
- Staffer Kiara Whitney entered QP per Clinical following news that her Preceptor had tested COVID-positive alongside concerns expressed by Whitney that said person had not observed proper safety mesaures with respect to PPE. 
- Spoke with Hotel Staff and Whitney to explain Krucial Onsite's role as a resource throughout the process. We will provide daily updates going forward.
- Touched base with new arrivals to outline initial onboarding process.
- Staffers Dominque Brown and Latresha Waters, who previously expressed an inability to work nightshift to the facility during orientation, reached out both Krucial and BCFS IST to indicate they were asked to shadow as a result of lack of available computer training during B Shift, noting a desire to return home early to attend training in the AM. BCFS indicated that the Hospital needed to sort out the finalization of their training with the RAC, which was then communicated to the staffers. Specifically, they were informed by both Krucial and BCFS of the expectation that they complete their shift and await further instruction pending the RAC's determination. They were also informed that upon completion of their shift, should did not wish to await the RAC's instruction, we would be happy to discuss their options with them at that time. Waters acknowledged and agreed to await further instruction. Brown was somewhat agitated and combative about being asked to complete her shift, so we will be monitoring her response tomorrow to ensure she understands the nature of the deploy and the proceedures that facilitate her schedule.
- Cotinued training of new Krucial Onsite Shane Seifert, who earned a big Shout Out for hopping right in and displaying an amazing attitude! Go Shane!",,

* Spoke with Regional about an issue with one of our Bus Drivers this evening. A quick overview: The staff from Wadley Regional Medical Center have been getting held a bit late due to the issue of being assigned patients less than 10-15 minutes before the end of their shifts (TFL was informed of this, FYI). As noted in a recent update, this has led to them being held over at the Facility upwards of 45-60 minutes on a couple occasions. The driver from Wynn, Sam, who handles their bus has become increasingly frustrated over the issue and has been confrontational and upset with the nurses over the situation, prompting them to come speak to us about his behavior. Summary of these issues is being provided by the Staffers, and we will issue a full report upon receipt.

FIELD DATA UPDATE

* Spoke with Clinical, BCFS and Regional re: incident at Christus Mother Francis involving RN Leslie Bellow, who had a patient enter into respiratory distress. Bellow was unable to reach anyone at the facility for assistance at the time and after numerous attempts to rectify the situation with facility staff, Bellow then reached out to BCFS, who called KOR here at Texarcana, who reached out to Clinical.
* Clinical has indicated they are awaiting response from Bellow.
* KOR also reached out to Bellow again in this AM and we are awaiting response. 
* Reviewed circumstances of this incident in a general sense with all staff to help improve situational awareness in the event that they find themselves unable to request necessary assistance to provide proper patient care, including communication chain and reminder of available documentation for Safe Harbor Guidelines.

PAYROLL UPDATE
* Reiterated to all staff that travel time to and from facility is not paid time in this deploy.
* Informed all staff that hours exceeding total of 12 per shift would require signed verification from Facility going forward.
* Generated and distributed new Timesheets by Facility for all staff such that necessary signatures can be acquired in a timely fashion for the upcoming week.
* Aided in the correction and verification of Timesheet Data for A & B Shift staffers across facilities, including Remotes.

BCFS OPS UPDATE
* Processed DEMOB for Kari Melvin, who’s journey with the Krucial Krew has come to an end following her planned 14-day deploy.
* Alerted BCFS to DEMOB per newly installed protocol requiring communication of data above and beyond info already available on WebEOC related to their Backfill discussions with the RAC. 

FIELD DATA UPDATE
* Backfill requested for RN Zainab Savard per Clinical by way of BCFS due to staffer being placed on AL pending investigation.
* Awaiting word on Backfill for Kari Melvin per BCFS while they get clarification from RAC on desired Class and Specialty to ensure SMA compliance.

KOR UPDATE

* Spoke with Kiara Whitney. She’s feeling fine and, following her eval, is now on full QP.
* Also spoke with WC about her ability to get supplies while quarantined, as she has repeatedly denied offers for aid from KOR, but earlier told WC she had no access or aid. WC followed up after speaking with KOR, also offering to help, and they were able to confirm that she emphatically refused all offers for aid in gathering supplies.
* Following a conversation with Clinical, we spoke with RN Leslie Bellow, who you may recall from the A Shift report, as she had called off for the evening with symptoms related to Vertigo, for which she takes maintenance medication. She will be back to work in the AM.

PAYROLL UPDATE
* Filled out and submitted Timesheets for KOR Staff.
* Continued to aid in the correction and verification of Timesheet Data for A & B Shift staffers across facilities, including Remotes.

BCFS OPS UPDATE
* Processed DEMOB for Zainab Savarad, who was also featured in the A Shift Report. She decided to go home.
* Submitted Backfill requests for 4 total staffers, per BCFS and the RAC.

FIELD DATA UPDATE
* Spoke with Jennifer Goldsmith regarding some Backfills meant for McAllen mistakenly sent to our location. She is looking into whether or not there is a possibility to just transfer them in for pending Backfills here submitted today as this will speed up their entry into the field. Awaiting an update on this one.
* Notified Field Data that one our our Incoming Staffers, Richard Saenz, tested positive for COVID-19 and has to cancel. Awaiting Reponse.

KOR UPDATE
* Attended BCFS PM Conference Call.
* Spoke to BCFS re: new arrivals, shift report changes for new TFL, and KOR role in QP.  
* Contacted and confirmed Incoming Staff arrival times for 3 of 4 anticipated staffers.

* Got approval from Regional for mistakenly assigned staffers Brittany Grund and Shanette Ricketts to be Transferred to Texarkana, who were originally noted as McAllen assets.
* Alerted McAllen KOR staff of transfer data for reporting purposes.

HUMAN RESOURCES UPDATE
* Spoke to Clinical re: Mt. Pleasant/TCRMC staffer RN Latricia Waters. Another staffer (Danielle Taylor) at the facility texted KOR staff to inform us that Waters had an altercation with Facility staff, yelling at the ED RN and the ED Charge, refusing to take a patient until their chart was deemed sufficient in her opinion. Awaiting full report following initial Clinical Inquiry.

BCFS OPS UPDATES
* Spoke with Regional RE: BCFS now requiring nurses to report for sign-in 25 minutes early for a bi-daily briefing. Nurses have inquired as to whether or not they will get paid for this time, but this would place all staff over 12-hour limited noted by KHQ during Friday call. Sending written inquiry shortly, but staff are already universally agitated by this change.

LOGS UPDATE
* Requested new Ink Cartridges for Printer
* Spoke to Regional about outstanding Rental Car Request from Tuesday, 08/18/2020.

KOR UPDATE
* Attended BCFS AM Conference Call.
* Set Orientation time for new Incoming Staff.
* Conducted AM Briefing with BCFS.

BCFS OPS UPDATE
* Inquired about staffing concern related to compensation for BCFS-mandated pre-shift briefings. Awaiting response.

CLINICAL UPDATE
* While attempting to deliver a care package to Quarantined staffer Kiara Whitney, we came to discover that she had left the hotel and called Clinical to see if she had notified them of her departure, which she had not. Worth Noting: She had previously asked about completing her QP from home.
* Moments after this discovery, she called KOR Staffer Shane Seifert (who did not make the trip to Mt. Pleasant) to inform us she had just completed her remote Telemed Eval, and that she was going to receive her COVID test on Thursday, failing to mention her departure.
* Roughly 30 seconds later, KOR Staff in Mt. Pleasant then called and let her know we were at the hotel to check up on her, to which she replied she was fine, again failing to mention her departure.
* We then asked WHERE she was. Whitney suddenly recalled that she had a family emergency and she was packing to leave. When we let her know we were in her empty room, she said she was “just down the street.”
* We then called Clinical to update them, and they reached out a second time gaining a bit more info on her departure. They have mailed us a summary of the conversation we plan to attach as an Incident Report when she provides us with a Demob form, which was requested from her earlier this afternoon.

LOGS UPDATE
* Delivered (1) Rental vehicle from Tyler TX Inventory to Sulphur Springs, TX.

1. Antonette Gordon should be transferred from the Hampton Inn, Mission TX Roster - to my Motel 6, Mission TX roster. Originally she was only going to stay at Motel 6 for 3 nights while Alberto and Gilbert waited for a room to open up at Hampton Inn. However, my group at Motel 6 is being moved to another hotel again beginning today. Since we support the same hospital, we will hang onto Antonette rather than move her to Hampton later this week. I have noted her as the ""New Arrival"" on this report. A transfer email request was sent by Alberto Lazo yesterday evening (8/24). 
2. We are moving. 
We are starting the process today with A shift, completing the process tomorrow with B shift. This group will move from Motel 6, Mission TX to Quality Inn & Suites, Rio Grande City. 
The A shift will move over after their shift this evening (8/25). The B shift will move over after their shift tomorrow morning 8/26). 
Would you all be able to help move our Roster to the Rio Grande City folder tomorrow once our move is complete? 
Hope this isn't too confusing, I'm here for any questions. Thank you for your help. ",,

* Updated Live Roster.
* Welcomed (3) incoming Transfers from Tyler, TX. 
* Spoke to Regional and BCFS re: recent Backfill, confirming suspicion that it would be held until inclement weather has subsided and communicated this to TFL.

LOGS UPDATE
* Assigned recently-delivered Rental Car to Christus Mother Francis staffer Bunnie Strand due to scheduling needs at new facility, CMF-Winnsboro. Notification to follow upon confirmation of receipt of keys by Strand.

BCFS OPS
* Added new Incoming Staff to GroupMe.
* Received a call from staffer Dominique Hill re: travel restriction, as Hill plans to Demob this evening. Hill noted her displeasure on travel restrictions issued by BCFS IC this AM, noting that “airlines aren’t cancelling travel. Why on earth are you?” Hill also noted that if she were able to fly out, she might just  “pretend she didn’t see the notification” about the restriction and leave anyways. 
* She was informed she should not due so for her own safety, but that we would follow up with official word on the exact nature of the protocol.  
*To that end, we spoke with our TFL, who noted she should be aware she was “employed under a State Disaster contract, and as such, she was classified as an essential worker of the state, and that laws governing direct orders of this sort were binding.”  
* Before this could be verified with Regional, Hill called back to inform us her flight had been cancelled, and that she would update us soon re: her intent to Demob.  
* We will be monitoring this closely in the short term, and have notified our Regional of the above information with the understanding that since the situation appears to be contained until the storm has passed, we can wait for any recommendations of disciplinary action at that time.

KOR UPDATE
* Attended BCFS PM Conference Call.
* Sent notification to staff via GroupMe regarding limitation of travel. Also provided clarity on difference between Travel (in/out of Theater) vs. Movement (in/out of Facility).
* Met with BCFS TFL to discuss incident involving staffer Bunnie Strand. Write-up in progress and will be forwarded to HR upon completion.
* Updated Sign-In Sheets to reflect Incoming Staff.

I see the changes already happening in the rosters on teams but thought i should still note that we are in transition to the Quality Inn & Suites, Rio Grande City. The A shift moved over this evening. The B shift will move over when they get off shift tomorrow morning. 
Currently there is not an option for the Quality Inn, in the system (census online form, backfill online form). I'm sure this is in the works but wanted to mention it for good measure.

I received instruction to demob her, citing an issue with her current CNA license verification with the state of Illinois.  
She provided some documents for review after contacting her current hospital HR department. I'm waiting on a response from HR after reviewing some documentation I sent with her work verification status.

* Relocated (1) Rental Car from Paris, TX to Sulphur Springs, TX.

KOR UPDATE
* Relocated KOR staffer Alonzo Smith from Texarkana, TX to Sulphur Springs, TX per BCFS request.
* Attended BCFS AM Conference Call.
* Spoke with BCFS TFL re: staffer Sharron Williams. Williams recently learned of a death and the family and, in spite of her knowledge of Krucial protocols, opted to attempt to a schedule adjustment via the Facility and BCFS.
* Specifically, Williams spoke with the Facility about changing her day off, and following their accommodation, spoke with the Texarkana BCFS IST about her wishes.
* BCFS IST noted this was not there call, and advised her to contact her Onsite.
* Williams called Onsite Alonzo Smith (Sulphur Springs – Not Texarkana where she was based. Smith reiterated policy of no schedule changes.
*Williams replied “Well, is there someone above you I can speak with to get better answers.” Smith referred her to Onsite Brandon Justice, who oversees her location.
* Williams then reached out to TFL Grant DiCianni instead.
*DiCianni reached out to Justice, who reiterated Krucial policy, explaining her options and noting the potential ramifications that would likely result from deviation, requesting the opportunity to put the request through the proper channels, to which BFCS agreed.
* DiCainni then, without alerting the Onsite, opted to take the issue up his chain, gaining permission to make the change. He then called Justice to let him know the “directive came from people far above him to do the human thing and allow the switch.
*When the Onsite reminded him of their prior agreement to take the matter to the appropriate parties and the pandora’s box this decision would open, DiCianni claimed it was out of his hands and that we would just have to make the best of it.
*DiCianni then reached out to Clinical Liaison Philomena Cunningham for another perspective without noting he had been briefed by Justice, and requested that Cunningham communicate a confirmation of the schedule change to the Onsite.
*At this point, Justice reached out to Regional to determine if this was acceptable in light of roles and responsibilities. Regional agreed that this decision could cause problems in the future, but at this point, the best course of action as to document the issue and keep a close eye on the situation to ensure that Williams stuck to the adjusted schedule.

* Updated Live Roster

LOGS UPDATE:
* Transferred staffer Semere Abadi from Mt. Pleasant, TX to Texarkana, TX including the acquisition of appropriate lodging.

KOR UPDATE
* Attended BCFS AM Conference Call.
* Conducted BCFS AM Sync with focus on confirming orientation for Wadley RN ICUs.
* Conducted KOR AM Sync with focus on maintaining RAC-wide comms with new TFL.
* Received feedback on SMA data from BCFS IST.

BFCS OPS UPDATE 1
* Upon alerting TFL that we had received word that all Backfills were currently on hold, we received information request re: hold on Backfills for two RN ICU staff filed on 09/15/2020. There was some confusion/pushback on the matter, and to which we verbally conveyed info received from Krucial Command indicating that this order appeared to be broad in nature, and that all indications were that it came from BCFS IC (per an email we received on 09/15).
* We then fielded a call from TFL indicating that this information was in dispute per their chain of command. TFL has asked for copy of said email. Awaiting approval from Krucial Command before sending to ensure compliance with protocol.

BFCS OPS UPDATE 2
* Fielded phone call at roughly 0715 from TFL asking that Incoming Titus Regional Medical Center staffer Semere Abadi attend orientation at facility at 0800.
* Abadi was immediately contacted and advised to report to facility, and did so.
* We subsequently received a phone call indicating that Abadi was expected at Wadley Regional Medical Center, not Titus. 
* Investigation of all written correspondence indicated no such transfer request from TFL. In fact, correspondence as recent as 0751 on 09/16 validated data provided in a routine Roster Audit that clearly indicated Abadi was a TRMC asset. 
* Multiple emails with similar confirmation have been archived in the event they are required.
* Staffer was then contacted by Krucial Onsite and is presently enroute to Texarkana, and will attend orientation at Wadley upon arrival.

Inconsideration of her not feeling well, I sent her a text indicating that she could come down when she felt capable of doing so. After evening sign in, I  attempted to call Ms. Mazza via my cell and the hotel phone with no answer. Ms. Mazza also did not respond to my text message. Joined by the front desk attended I went to knock on her door and perform a welfare check. We could hear retching and coughing behind the door. Upon opening the door Ms. Mazza indicated she was experiencing nausea and vomiting. I asked her she wanted to go to Urgent Care or if she wanted me to call the CL. She requested that I call the CL, which I did. The CL was going to follow-up with Ms. Mazza and update me after doing so.

BCFS OPS UPDATE
* Fielded question from BCFS TFL re: Call-Off policy about 2-hour window. Confirmed policy, which was met with significant frustration from TFL.
* Suggested to TFL that Onsites could request nurses who are able to provide more notice do so, which met with approval.
* Will communicate this request to all staff, all shifts no later than A Shift 09/25, reiterating that 2-hour requirement is still proper notice, if they know in advance, we always appreciate helping the facility plan for their absence in an effort to provide continuous care to their patients.

KOR UPDATE
* Attended BCFS PM Conference Call.
* Conducted BCFS PM Sync with focus on Call-Off Protocol
* Conducted KOR AM Sync, with focus on Call-Off Protocol and Incoming Staff

HR UPDATE 
* Due to an early notice of intent to Demobilize from the operation on 10/17/2020, Wadley Regional Medical Center erroneously noted staffer Sheila Dumont’s last day as 10/16/2020 and sent her home from the facility today without proper written notice. BCFS instructed KOR to transport Ms. Dumont back to facility to either complete her work day or obtain said notice, but Ms. Dumont refused to return to work, saying that the matter was concluded. We attempted to inform her of protocol and that BCFS had instructed her to return until properly released by facility, to which Ms. Dumont became agitated and refused, hastily indicating that she chose to take the facility’s instruction over that of her employers and that she would accept no further clarification or instruction on the matter, hanging up the phone. Clarification of protocol following said refusal was subsequently provided in writing to ensure Ms. Dumont was aware of BCFS protocols, which were again refuted and refused by staffer. BCFS has asked that an incident report be filed over the matter, which KOR will promptly provide following the A Shift Census report.
